# 🧬 Game of Life (Java)

A Java implementation of **Conway’s Game of Life**, the classic cellular automaton that simulates how simple rules can create complex behavior.

## 🎮 Overview
Each cell on a grid lives, dies, or reproduces based on its neighbors.  
This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming** and **simulation logic** in Java.

## 🧩 Features
- Grid-based world with living and dead cells  
- Automatic generation updates based on Conway’s rules  
- Step-by-step or continuous simulation modes  
- Classes for player, character, and world logic

## 🚀 Run
```bash
javac *.java
java GameofLife
